# COSC-4351 Class Project

******************************  WHAT IS THIS? ******************************
This project required that we (group of 3) create a way for users to reserve
a table at a particular restaurant.

******************************  WHAT WERE THE OBJECTIVES? ******************************
The requirements were such that only tables of 2, 4, 6, and 8 seats were available,
and that if a single table was not sufficient, the system would automatically combine
smaller tables as required.

This project is not 100% realistic in the sense that many restaurants do not contain
a system like this, however, as students we are obliged to focus on the given objectives.

****************************** HOW WAS IT MADE? ******************************
Much of the code is based in HTML, but CSS is used to make it easier on the eye, and PHP
is utilized as the backbone of the behavior. Some JavaScript is utilized in conjunction
with Materialize.

The database used was MySQL, and the whole stack was linked together using AWS's EC2 and RDS
cloud-based systems.
